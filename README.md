[![Toolbar Panel Demo](http://img.youtube.com/vi/KTPwKYvP6OI/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTPwKYvP6OI)

This library is inspired from Android Drawerlayout, but instead of showing drawer from either left or right this library will provide you function to pull down the toolbar to show a panel which you can customize by yourself.
